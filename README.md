This visualization shows the changes in indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity in different rooms of Sampson Hall over a week.

The bars represent temperature (yellow-indoor, blue-outdoor), and the lines represent humidity (light green for indoor, light orange for outdoor). The left Y-axis represents temperature (Celsius). The right Y-axis represents humidity (percentage). Use the arrow keys to navigate: UP and DOWN switching the rooms, LEFT and RIGHT switching the dates.


I learned how to load and read datas in Processing. Use arrays to store and display different sets. Use double Y-axis to display two independent data.

How to align all data when switching rooms or dates. How to make the humidity curve update better when switching dates or rooms.


I will add weekly average temperature and humidity. Add hover labels to display temperature and humidity values.I will improve the visualization colors to make it better and easier to read.
